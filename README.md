# EyePatch

EyePatch is PowerMocking for Android tests (a.k.a instrumentation

levels, or class configurations where this doesn't work.

The best example to get started with is in our own tests: https://github.com/tdrhq/eyepatch/blob/master/eyepatch/src/androidTest/java/com/tdrhq/eyepatch/ExampleIntegrationTest.java
